  <h1>üúè Project One: Neon Knights / Nova Knights</h1>
  <h2>Act I ‚Äî The Spark</h2>

  <p><strong>Before everything there was nothing, and as soon as there was something, it was infinite.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Set on the edge of the far-future Milkdromeda galaxy, a realm where science and sorcery blur, the Solarian Imperium rules with celestial tyranny. 
    Entire systems orbit its throne. Beneath its golden banner, communities thrive‚Äîand suffer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the stardust shadows lives <strong>Am√©lie</strong>, a splicer of code and whispers, unaware of her true bloodline. Once discarded like broken tech, she rose 
    through grit, street-fire, and stolen data. Raised by outlaws. Hardened by espionage. Loved once by Lelouch‚Äîuntil fate tore him away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her path twists when she disobeys orders and peers into the core of a robot named <strong>Ace</strong>. There, she beholds the 
    <em>Divine Code</em>‚Äîa living singularity of logic and myth. Her joke question‚Äî‚ÄúHow do I reverse entropy?‚Äù‚Äîis answered.  
    Coordinates. A deck of tarot that bends reality. A magic the empire thought dead.
  </p>

  <p>
    With new allies‚ÄîConnor and ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ÄîAm√©lie escapes with Ace, yet every answer blooms more questions:  
    <em>What is the Divine Code? Who else saw it? And what now awakens in her blood?</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Act I Climax ‚Äî Power‚Äôs First Edge</h2>
  <p>
    A prison ship. A failing system. Not enough food for thousands. Only for a handful.  
    Am√©lie walks to the command console, civilians and teammates behind her. Her voice shakes as she jettisons every non-cockpit module.  
    <strong>Thousands die.</strong> Instantly.  
  </p>

  <p>
    She watches their faces, pressed to the glass as the void claims them.  
    Her first command. Her first murder. Her first impossible choice.  
    Power has awakened. It is hungry.
  </p>
